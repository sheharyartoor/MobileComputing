    				<h1>BS</h1>
    				<p>The purpose of Computer Science degree programs is to produce computer scientists, who can form the backbone of the rapidly growing computer industry. The BS program is focused on developing an in depth understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of computer science through a rigorous course work spanning over a period of four years. Students are given unique opportunities to go beyond traditional computer science and get themselves involved in research activities through various research and industrial collaboration programs carried out at the campuses. This ensures a broad based educational foundation that prepares them for leadership roles along diverse career paths.
To equip students with modern trends in the ever changing field of computer science, courses are offered in concentration areas of Semantic Web, Multi-Agent Intelligent Systems, Networks, Data Mining and Data Warehousing, Software Engineering and Quality Assurance, Graphics and Game Programming, Image Processing, Soft Computing, Corporate and Business Computing, E-commerce etc. Students select courses from these areas to match with their future career options in a broad range of industrial, corporate, multinational, governmental and non-governmental organizations. Our courseware is tailored according to the international standards to nurture capacity building and original thinking in our graduates for life-long-learning. No doubt that our graduates are highly sought after by a majority of national and international IT industry.</p>

    				<h1>BS</h1>
    				<p>The Electrical Engineering degree is based on the HEC/PEC approved curriculum. In the first year the students learn the fundamentals of Electrical Engineering supported by essential mathematics and physics courses. These courses are followed by breadth courses which introduce students to different specialties in Electrical Engineering. In the senior year students choose a specialization stream and study advanced courses. Currently specializations are being offered in three areas, Telecommunication Engineering, and Computer Engineering. In the highly competitive job market a young engineer is not only required to be knowledgeable in technical areas but is also expected to have excellent communication and managerial skills and an appreciation of modern day economics to design and implement a cost effective engineering solution. Students are offered courses in communication skills, engineering management and economics to prepare them for challenging environments. Social Science electives and courses in Professional Ethics contribute in enhancing the soft skills and help prepare a well rounded personality. The course work is supported by state of the art engineering labs. During four years, students work in twelve different labs where they perform experiments using state of the art instruments, equipment and simulation software.</p>

  				<div data-role="collapsible">
    				<h1>MS</h1>
    				<p>This program prepares a graduate in Electrical Engineering to acquire expertise in a particular area. In the final year, the student normally undertakes a thesis. This may be undertaken in collaboration with the industry, under the guidance of industry experts and a faculty supervisor from the University.
A student has the option to pursue MS by undertaking either a 6 credit hour MS Thesis or MS Project, spread over two regular semesters.
Typical course load in a semester is four courses. However, NUCES staff cannot register for more than two courses in a semester.</p>

    				<p>Change is the only constant known today to the business world which has to grapple with the challenging realities of an increasingly global and complex marketplace. The Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) program at FAST attempts to bring out dynamic managers and administrators, well-equipped to meet the challenges posed by this highly competitive global marketplace. To this end, the approach in the classroom is tailored to inculcate an appreciation for both the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of business. Quantitative skills developed through such areas as accounting, statistics, financial modelling and linear programming are combined with qualitative skills in communication, human psychology, marketing and organizational behaviour. Using these diverse skills and tools, BBA graduates are expected to be able to provide timely solutions to real-world business problems – solutions that are cost-effective, efficient and ethically correct.</p>

  				<div data-role="collapsible">
    				<h1>MS</h1>
    				<p>This program enables students to develop skills necessary to manage software projects. In the final year, students take a Practicum course, which involves supervision of undergraduate students’ projects. In the final semester, the student either undertakes a Research/Industry survey or Thesis along with the second part of the Practicum course.
The MS (Software Project Management) program focuses on strengthening students’ knowledge in theoretical as well as practical aspects of managing software projects. The program not only addresses management issues related to software industry but also covers the software engineering concepts, which must be known to a project manager.
The aim is to prepare middle and top management so that they meet the challenges of present and future needs of software industry. The coursework exposes the students to management and technical issues encountered in development of software solutions. The students are expected to do research for their theses.</p>
